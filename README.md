## Introduction ##
[‚Üë Table of contents](#table-of-contents)

From product they ask us to create a visual part or frontend for an application of management of own tasks type Trello. It would be a more basic revision of the popular app.

The functionalities that the user must be able to perform will be to create lists and the consequent internal tasks of each list, as well as being able to move tasks between lists.


## Description
[‚Üë Table of contents](#table-of-contents)

Taking into account the requirements, we came to the conclusion that this would be the recommended functionality:

- Once the lists have been created, it should allow us to create internally Tasks.
- We must have enough tools to be able to delete tasks and lists.
- As in Trello, the lists must be organized by columns, and internally the tasks must also be able to organize them internally.

## Demo

This Trello clone allows you to have multiple boards, creating them, deleting them and editing their title and content.
In addition, in each one we can create several columns, delete or edit them and reorganize them as we want.
Finally, we have the cards. We can modify them as much as we want and move them comfortably through the drag and drop functionality.
