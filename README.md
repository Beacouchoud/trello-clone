## Introduction
[↑ Table of contents](#table-of-contents)

From product they ask us to create a visual part or frontend for an application of management of own tasks type Trello. It would be a more basic revision of the popular app.

The functionalities that the user must be able to perform will be to create lists and the consequent internal tasks of each list, as well as being able to move tasks between lists.


## Description
[↑ Table of contents](#table-of-contents)

Taking into account the requirements, we came to the conclusion that this would be the recommended functionality:

- Once the lists have been created, it should allow us to create internally Tasks.
- We must have enough tools to be able to delete tasks and lists.
- As in Trello, the lists must be organized by columns, and internally the tasks must also be able to organize them internally.


## Technologies

For the development of the frontend, React will be used with [React](https://es.reactjs.org/), [react-router](https://reactrouter.com/) and [react-redux](https://react-redux.js.org/). 
Has been used ES6, including some Promises and async/await functionality.

For the layout, has been implmented FlexBox and GridLayout.

For the implementation of the drag and drop has been used the library [react-beautiful-dnd](https://github.com/atlassian/react-beautiful-dnd#readme).

The project has been uploaded to a public GitHub repository in multiple branches, as well as diverse and readable commits with the evolution of the draft, using the [Conventional Commits specification](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).

The repository also includes a complete Readme complete, in addition.
